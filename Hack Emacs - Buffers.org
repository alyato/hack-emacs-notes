* Buffer Concept
  - Buffers aren't files!
  - You can view the same buffer in multiple places and/or ways.

* Speeding Up Buffer Access
  - Two available modes
    - ido-mode (Emacs 22+)
    - iswitchb-mode (Emacs 21)

  - With either of these modes, you still use C-x b
  - Rotate through available buffers with C-s and C-r
  - Filter buffers by typing!
  - Kill buffers from the menu with C-k
  - Create a new buffer by typing the name 
    - Press enter twice in ido-mode
    - Press y in iswitchb-mode
