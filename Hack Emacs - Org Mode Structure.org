* Org-Mode Structure
  The content of this section will review the high points of section 2
  of the Org-Mode Manual "Document Structure"
** Headlines start with a "*" character and start at column 0
   - The way the buffer is displayed can be changed by activating "Clean View"
     - Kind of a new feature, might not be available unless you're
       using 23.1+ Emacs with 6.29+ Org-Mode
     - Can be toggled with M-x org-indent-mode
   - Different levels of headlines are color-coded so you can see structure easily
** Focusing on a section of the structure
   There are two main ways to focus your (or your viewers') attention
   on just one section of the structure.
*** Visibility cycling
    - Each headline or list has three possible visibility states:
      1. Completely visible
      2. Only Headlines visible
      3. Completely folded (only top headline visible)
    - Pressing <tab> on a headline folds the structure under the headline
    - Pressing <shift>-<tab> cycles through visibility levels for *all* headlines
*** Buffer narrowing
    - Buffer narrowing limits the /view/ of the current buffer,
      allowing commands that normally operate on the entire buffer to
      be applied to a speific region.
      - Search/Replace
      - Export (in the case of Org-Mode)
    - It also allows you to focus entirely on a single area of the org file
      - Narrow the buffer to a subtree using C-x n s
      - Widen the view back to the entire buffer with C-x n w
** Working with Lists
   - Lists come in two flavors: bullet lists and numbered lists
     - These correspond exactly to ordered lists and unordered lists
       in HTML (<ol> and <ul>, respectively)
   - You can change the nature of a list using <shift>-<left> and
     <shift>-<right> while focused an an elemment of the list
** Movement within the Structure
   - Move to the previous headline with C-c C-p (previous)
   - Move to the next headline with C-c C-n (next)
   - Move to the next higher headline in the structure with C-c C-u
   - Move to headlines at the same level with C-c C-f and C-c C-b (forward and back)
** Modifying the Structure
*** Inserting headlines
    - The most basic command is M-<return>, which, if you're on a new
      line, adds new headline at the current level.
      - If you're within a list, adds a new item to the list
    - If you're within a headline, you can add a new headline at the
      current level using C-<return>
*** Moving, Promoting and Demoting Items
    - Single items, either list items or headlines, can be moved up and down with M-<up> and M-<down>
    - Single items (again, list items or headlines) can be promoted or demoted with M-<left> and M-<right>
    - Entire subtrees can be promoted or demoted with M-S-<left> and M-S-<right>
