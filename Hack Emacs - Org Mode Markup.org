* Org-Mode Markup
  Text in Org Mode can be /marked up/ with various characters to give it style.  This affects:
  - The way the text appears in the buffer
  - The way the text /behaves/ in the buffer (potentially)
  - The way the text appears and behaves when it is exported
    - This can vary widely, depending on the backend used for exporting (HTML, \LaTeX, plain text, etc.)
    - More on exporting in another Org Mode In Depth episode
** Fonts and color themes
   Depending on what color theme and font settings you have, you might
   be able to see that the text is marked up.  For example, look at
   this /italic/, *bold* and _underlined_ text in two different color
   themes:
   - [[elisp:(color-theme-high-contrast)][High Contrast]]
   - [[elisp:(color-theme-comidia)][Comidia]]
** Simple markup
   Most markup in Org Mode just adds some symbols (like *, _, /, [, ],
   and \) to normal text to tell Org Mode that the text is special in
   some way.
   - *bold*
   - /italic/
   - _underline_
   - Links are automatically "linkified" http://google.com
     - http://emacswiki.org
     - They can be opened by clicking on them or...
     - by pressing C-c C-o
   - Use the format
     : [[http://google.com][Google]]
     without the ":" to create a link. It will look like this:
     [[http://google.com][Google]]
   - As you notice above, you can avoid special markup processing by
     beginning your line with ": "
** Symbols
   - If you writing text (especially technical notes) that require
     symbols, Org Mode seamlessly supports \LaTeX symbols syntax:
     - Union and Intersection: \cup \cap
     - Greek characters: \pi \Sigma \alpha \beta
     - Mathematical relations: x \le y
     - Chemical reactions (in this case, electrolysis of water): 2H_{2}O \rightarrow 2H_2 + O_2
     - Superscripts: x * x = x^2
     - and many others (go a [[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=+latex+symbols&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=][Google Search]] for "latex symbols")
** Links
   Links probably warrant an entire episode of their own.  But...
   - Links can be any of a ton of types, the most obvious being things like:
     - ftp://
     - http://
     - file:
     - mailto:
   - But also including awesome types like:
     - elisp:
     - shell:
   - These kinds of powerful links give you the ability to write Org
     Mode files that are programs that have "buttons" that invoke
     code
*** Examples (for fun)
    - [[elisp:(color-theme-subtle-hacker)]]
      : [[elisp:(color-theme-subtle-hacker)]]
    - [[elisp:(color-theme-comidia)][Comidia]]
      : [[elisp:(color-theme-comidia)][Comidia]]
    - [[shell:ls -lR]]
      :  [[shell:ls -lR]]
