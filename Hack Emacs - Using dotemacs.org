* Naming
  ".emacs" is actually shorthand.  Your initialization file could be any of:
  - ~/.emacs
  - ~/.emacs.el
  - ~/.emacs.d/init.el
* Initialization files are just elisp
  You can run anything you like.  But, if you want Emacs to start
  quickly, make sure that nothing too intensive gets run from your
  init file.
  - Loading large add-on packages can take a lot of time
    - Consider using "autoload" or "idle-require" in these cases
    - Make sure to use "byte-recompile-directory" to make sure your
      add-ons are optimized for loading
* Try out your commands before using them
  - Use the ever-useful *scratch* buffer
  - If you want, use ielm (Interactive Emacs Lisp Mode)
  - If you need to test commands in a specific buffer, use M-: to
    evaluate lisp on-the-fly
* Make your commands idempotent
  - Use "eval-buffer" to test your init file, rather than restarting Emacs
  - Examples:
    - [[elisp:(column-number-mode%201)][(column-number-mode 1)]] vs [[elisp:(column-number-mode)][(column-number-mode)]]
* Basic useful examples (to get you started)
  - Modes
    - [[elisp:(column-number-mode%201)][(column-number-mode 1)]]
    - [[elisp:(ido-mode%201)][(ido-mode 1)]]
    - [[elisp:(show-paren-mode%201)][(show-paren-mode 1)]]
    - [[elisp:(global-visual-line-mode 1)][(global-visual-line-mode 1)]]
    - [[elisp:(mouse-avoidance-mode%20'banish)][(mouse-avoidance-mode 'banish)]]
  - Accelerators
    - [[elisp:(global-set-key "\C-xc" 'calendar)][(global-set-key "\C-xc" 'calendar)]]
    - [[elisp:(global-set-key "\C-xt" 'eshell)][(global-set-key "\C-xt" 'eshell)]]
