** Outline Processor
 - It's a great example of the power of exposing the language the editor was written in -- an entire application written in Emacs Lisp!
 - Now included in GNU Emacs (22+)
*** Supports structural editing
    - Headlines
    - Bullet Lists
    - Numbered Lists
    - Visibility cycling
    - Drawers, block quotes, properties, and much more.
*** Sticks to plain text!
That means you can access and edit the content of your org files regardless of the operating system or computational capabilities of the platform you're on!
